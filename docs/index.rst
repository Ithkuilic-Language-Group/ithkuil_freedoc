   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

######################################################
Welcome to The New Ithkuilic Language's documentation!
######################################################

Ithkuil_ is a `constructed language`_ designed by John Quijada that prioritizes
expressiveness and conciseness, and TNIL (“The New Ithkuilic Language” —
official name pending) is a successor language sharing many of its design
values.

.. _Ithkuil: http://ithkuil.net/
.. _constructed language: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language

This is a community-driven, GPLv3-licensed set of documentation for TNIL,
including graphics illustrating several morphological categories.

This documentation is still far from complete, and most features are lacking a
full description. If you are familiar with Ithkuilic grammar, please contribute!
Morphological and lexical information is stored in NILDB_, and all other text is stored in |docs_source|_ of `this repository`_.

.. _NILDB: https://github.com/HactarCE/NILDB
.. |docs_source| replace:: ``docs/source``
.. _docs_source: https://github.com/HactarCE/tnil-freedoc/tree/master/docs/source
.. _this repository: https://github.com/HactarCE/tnil-freedoc

Due to licensing ambiguity, translating of the lexicon is currently paused and
all other documentation must use original word; i.e. do not copy verbatim from
*A Grammar of Ithkuil* or any other texts written by Quijada.
