Configuration
=============
CONFIGURATION conveys the quantity, spatiotemporal continuity, and physical
similarity of the items named by the stem. Unlike [[Affiliation]], this
category focuses on the physical variation of the items, rather than on
variations of function or purpose. CONFIGURATION provides mass nouns for stems
and works together with [[Perspective]] to communicate number. It communicates
whether the members of a group are separate, touching, or fused together, and
also provides a way of talking about questionable or borderline applications
of the stem.

There are 9 Configurations:
- Uniplex_: *individual instance*
- Duplex_: *pair of instances*
- Discrete_: *many similar instances*
- aggregative_: *collection of dissimilar instances*
- segmentative_: *close or contiguous group of similar instances*
- componential_: *close or contiguous group of dissimilar instances*
- coherent_: *connected collection of similar instances*
- composite_: *connected collection of dissimilar instances*
- multiform_: *borderline or questionable instance*
